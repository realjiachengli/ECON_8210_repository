function [Vpred,bary,idx] = interpns(V,Xi,nodelist,method)
% interpne: Interpolates an array using simplicial interpolation
% usage: Vpred = interpns(V,Xi)
% usage: Vpred = interpns(V,Xi,nodelist)
%
% Note: Interpolates using a simplicial dissection of the n-d hyper-rectangle
% into factorial(n) simplexes. This is sometimes known as the diagonal
% extraction, where all simplexes share one edge along a main diagonal of
% the hyper-rectangle.
%
% Note: interpns does NOT perform extrapolation. For that behavior,
% you will need to use a tool like interpne.
%
% arguments: (input)
%  V - p-dimensional array to be interpolated/extrapolated at the list
%      of points in the array Xi.
%
%      Note: interpne will work in any number of dimensions >= 1
%
%  Xi - (n by p) array of n points to interpolate/extrapolate. Each
%      point is one row of the array Xi.
%
%  nodelist - (OPTIONAL) cell array of nodes in each dimension.
%      If nodelist is not provided, then by default I will assume:
%
%      nodelist{i} = 1:size(V,i)
%
%      The nodes in nodelist need not be uniformly spaced.
%
%
% arguments: (output)
%  Vpred - n by 1 array of interpolated/extrapolated values
%
%
% Example 1: 2d case
%  [x1,x2] = meshgrid(0:.2:1);
%  z = exp(x1+x2);
%  Xi = rand(1000,2);
%  Zi = interpns(z,Xi,{0:.2:1, 0:.2:1});
%  surf(0:.2:1,0:.2:1,z)
%  hold on
%  plot3(Xi(:,1),Xi(:,2),Zi,'r.')
%
%
% My apology: this interface is not fully compatible with that of
% interpn. But in higher dimensions, the interpn interface is both
% a mess to use and to write.
